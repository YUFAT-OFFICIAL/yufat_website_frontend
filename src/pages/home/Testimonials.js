              Yufat has been a beacon of light in my life.
              When I had to leave my home country DRC due to War,
              I felt lost. Yufat's training in coding and
              Microsoft applications not only gave me a sense
              of purpose but also the tools to secure a stable job.
              Yufat doesn't just teach skills; they restore dignity
              and hope to refugees like me.

                  Yufat gave me hope when I needed it the most.
                   As a refugee, I had lost everything.
                   But through their computer skills training,
                    I gained a new lease on life. Learning coding
                    and Microsoft applications not only empowered
                    me but also opened doors to job opportunities.
                     Yufat truly changes lives.

                   it's a lifeline for people like me.
                    Yufat taught me coding and Microsoft Word,
                     helping me develop skills that I can use to rebuild my life.
                      I'll forever be grateful to them.

                  Yufat's commitment to empowering refugees
                  through computer skills is truly remarkable.
                  As a Rohingya refugee, I faced immense adversity,
                  but Yufat's coding courses provided me with a sense of
                  direction and hope for a better future. I now have the
                  skills to pursue a career and contribute to society.
